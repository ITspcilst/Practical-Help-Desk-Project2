# 🛠️ Practical Help Desk Ticket (Linux User & Group Management)

--

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real Help Desk ticket that required adding new Linux users, enforcing password resets, and configuring secure access to a confidential directory using only standard Linux user/group and permission commands.
This task demonstrates core Linux administration skills that are essential for IT Support, SysAdmin, and Security roles.
